# Framework7 React Static Template

For most apps, it is recommended to start with the [template that leverages Create React App](https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-react-app-template/). This template is designed for use cases where a full build pipeline is not desired and only static JavaScript is needed.

To get started, clone this repo as whatever you want to name your app:

```
git clone https://github.com/bencompton/framework7-react-static-template/ my-app
```

To run the app, simply launch the index.html file.
